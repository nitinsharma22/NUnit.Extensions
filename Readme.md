NUnit.Extensions - Community extensions for NUnit
-------------------------------------------------

NUnit.Extensions is not affiliated with the NUnit project.

We aim to provide additional functionality for NUnit, when said functionality is not a good fit for the NUnit framework, itself.

We also want to foster innovation around testing by providing a place to try out and refine new ideas.
